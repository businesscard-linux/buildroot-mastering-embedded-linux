This is the repository accompanying my [Mastering Embedded Linux][mel] series of articles.
You can use it to follow along with the series.

## Repository structure

The repository is structured as a series of commits on top of Buildroot 2019.11.
As the series progresses, new branches will be added, sometimes based on a previous article, and sometimes based again on pure Buildroot.
In general, there is one branch per article.

I reserve the right to rebase these commits as need be to keep them clean and atomic if the series is updated.
Accordingly, use them only as a reference, not a starting point!
